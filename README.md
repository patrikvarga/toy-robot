# Toy Robot Simulator

## Description

See the description of the exercise [here](./DESCRIPTION.md).

## Usage

The solution is a Node.js project written in TypeScript.

To install dependencies, use: `npm i`. After this, the app is ready to use as there is no need for building anything.

To run the tests, use `npm run test`, or in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`.

Running the CLI is as easy as `npm start`. (Watch mode is also available using `npm run start:watch`.)
To use file input instead of stdin, use `npm start -- commands.txt`

In addition to the expected commands, you can also use `DEBUG`, `EXIT` and `HELP`. Type `HELP` in the tool to see details.
